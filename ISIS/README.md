The objective of this task is to perform the basic configuration of ISIS on the XRv Router.

Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook for details.

If you want to test your config, you can use quagga in the server. Follow the instructions in the quagga folder.

To check that the configuration is correct:
* Enter the ISIS daemon (see instructions in the quagga folder)
* `show isis interfaces` should show both interfaces being up.
* `show isis neighbor` should show the router.
