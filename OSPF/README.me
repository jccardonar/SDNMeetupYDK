The objective of this task is to perform the basic configuration of OSPF on the XRv router.

Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook for details.

If you want to test your config, you can use quagga in the server. Follow the instructions in the quagga folder.

To check that the configuration on both devices  is correct:

* Enter the OSPF daemon (see instructions in the quagga folder)
* `show ospf neighbor` should show the XR router.
