The purpose of this folder is to self-contain the files needed to demostrate the basics of YANG models and tools.

Please do not use the models here included, but try to visit the official repositories storing them.

See the tree of a module using pyang -f tree. For instance:
`pyang -f tree -p openconfig/ openconfig/openconfig-bgp.yang`
